### Hi there,👋
Hello,<br/>

I'm Qudus Adebola, a React frontend developer. I'm looking forward to leverage my working knowledge of React and other frontend web technologies to help individual/growing companies create frontend website/application that converts more customers and make more sales by combining their goals with their user's need<br/>

I take great pride in my ability to write clear and consistent code, prompt and professional communication and on my ability to build frontend website/application with: <br />
i.) Beautiful user interface<br/>
ii.) Functional user experience<br/>
iii.) Mobile/responsive design<br/>
iv.) Good web accessibility<br/>
v.) Great cross-browser compatibility.<br/>

As a person, I'm ambitious, goal driven, detail oriented and flexible. I'm also naturally curious, confident and always eager to broaden my horizon by learning different new technologies.
